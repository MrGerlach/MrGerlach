- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MrGerlach

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in music, love to play on my guitar and sing. Also an Apple fanboy. :) I like new technologies, especially assistive technologies for humanitarian and medical assistance. Since I am an experienced audiologist, I am still passionate about hearing aids and related technologies.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Swift (from May 2022), but I used to learn JavaScript basics, Python & Matlab. In addition to coding, in the future I would like to become a team manager, so I am currently studying Business Psychology at WSB Poznan.
